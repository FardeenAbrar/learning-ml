## Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is my solution to the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

### Files Included

- `titanic_ml_pipeline.ipynb`: My main notebook with all preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`: Datasets provided by Kaggle.
- `gender_submission.csv`: Sample submission format from Kaggle.
- `predictions.csv`: My model's predictions on the test set.

### Model Overview

- Preprocessing: Handled missing data, encoded categorical variables.
- Model: `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-learn.
- Evaluation: Accuracy checked with cross-validation and Kaggle leaderboard.

### Requirements

- pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
